libViscaQtUi
============

A QT UI for controlling a VISCA compatible camera using libVisca.

The development was tested using a Sony EVI-D100 and only the commands supported by this camera was added to the UI.

TODO:
----
* Update UI with actual values from camera on start up
* Add and implement focus control
* Run slider updates on separate thread to free up UI
* Variable zoom/pan/tilt-speed
* Add One Push WB Trigger button
* Add serialport selection and configuration
* Add lookuptable for hex value vs. camera model/manufacturer and display in UI
